<p>Combining a source file with a template to produce an output file is simple
enough, but where does that output file get placed? To begin, all output files
go under the <code>-output-path</code> directory. Their relative location underneath that
path is determined by their <code>output</code> metadata key.</p>

<p>If no <code>output</code> metadata is specified, grender will use the complete relative
path of the source file, minus its extension.</p>
