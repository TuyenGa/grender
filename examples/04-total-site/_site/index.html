 <h2>Random thoughts</h2>
<p>Returning to a moment; &ldquo;the becoming-expressive of rhythm&rdquo;.
What we try to construct is a territory, but relational, and the code which
emerges from that territory.</p>

<p>For example: in each profession, there&rsquo;s a professional language that comes
out of it. In animal groups, there are animal behaviors. A code comes from a
territory. &ldquo;Each milleu has its own code.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>Territorialization is a process; stratification is a process.</li>
<li>Stratification is concerning the strata, ie. the matter.</li>
<li>Territorialization is more about the assemblage.</li>
<li>Assemblage and strata are the same; assemblage is more decoded.</li>
<li>Assemblages are created <em>in</em> strata, in an area where a milleu decodes them.</li>
</ul>
