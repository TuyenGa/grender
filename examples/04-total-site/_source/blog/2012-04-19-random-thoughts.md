Returning to a moment; "the becoming-expressive of rhythm".
What we try to construct is a territory, but relational, and the code which
emerges from that territory.

For example: in each profession, there's a professional language that comes
out of it. In animal groups, there are animal behaviors. A code comes from a
territory. "Each milleu has its own code."

* Territorialization is a process; stratification is a process.
* Stratification is concerning the strata, ie. the matter.
* Territorialization is more about the assemblage.
* Assemblage and strata are the same; assemblage is more decoded.
* Assemblages are created _in_ strata, in an area where a milleu decodes them.
